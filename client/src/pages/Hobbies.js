                Below is a list of the ways I explore the world and seek to understand my place within it.
            </p>

            <li>Connection</li>
                <li id="subli">
                    Building and growing community is a talent that I find great joy and purpose in. Existing within and being supported by a group of individuals who chose one another due to shared purpose or identities or not by choice at all--but are committed to making the best of it-- is one of my core values. 
                </li>

                <li>Markmaking</li>
                    <li id="subli">
                        The desire to manifest my inner self started before I could read, with drawing and imitating writing. These days markmaking takes the form of watercoloring, journaling, and taking color-coordinated class notes. Web development is a new and complex facet of making marks that I am eagerly enjoying.
                    </li>

                <li>Reading</li>
                <li id="subli">
                    Learning to read unlocked my imagination, grew my heart, and gave me all the tools I needed to discover the world. I enjoy reading fiction (mostly fantasy) and am always open to non-fiction recommendations!
                    </li>

                <li>Pottery</li>
                    <li id="subli">
                        After 10 years working in the field I am delighted for the opportunity to ground my explorations in curiousity and play, rather than with a focus on production.
                    </li>

                <li>Dungeons and Dragons (DnD)</li>
                    <li id="subli">
                        Imagination is an incredibly important part of my identity. DnD allows me to engage with my imagination in dynamic ways that other mediums do not. Storytelling, make-believe, and community are all significant facets of this hobby for me.
                    </li>

                <li>Dicemaking</li>
                    <li id="subli">
                        The tools one uses to tell a story can be as crucial as the story itself. As a dicemaker I get to lean into alchemical discoveries that I usually reserve for glaze-making to create objects that capture moments of magic and mystery, both in the lab and at the gaming table.
                    </li>

                <li>Mandolin</li>
                    <li id="subli">
                        I came across the mandolin during a time of great stress. It served as a wonderful way to manage my anxiety and practice using a different part of my brain; one that feels very similar to the logic of coding.
